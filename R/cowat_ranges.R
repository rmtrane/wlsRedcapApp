#' \describe{Each of the columns AAA, BBB, ..., KKK gives cutoffs that are mapped
#' to intervals. Each interval corresponds to the standardized score that is in
#' the row where the beginning of the interval is given. For example, if an
#' individual from age group BBB has a `cog_flc_flu` score of 15, it falls in
#' the interval [13, 17), and the standardized score is then 3.
