#' \describe{Each of the columns AAAAA, BBBBB, ..., JJJJJ gives cutoffs that are mapped
#' to intervals. Each interval corresponds to the standardized score that is in
#' the row where the beginning of the interval is given. There are separate ranges
#' for men and women. For example, if an individual from age group EEEEE, who is a male,
#' has a `cog_ravlt_recog_acc` score of 80%, it falls in
#' the interval [80, 87), and the standardized score is then 9.
