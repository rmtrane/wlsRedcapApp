#' \describe{Each of the columns AAAA, BBBB, ..., FFFF gives cutoffs that are mapped
#' to intervals. Each interval corresponds to the standardized score that is in
#' the row where the beginning of the interval is given. For example, if an
#' individual from age group BBBB has a `cog_dig_symb` score of 15, it falls in
#' the interval [14, 18), and the standardized score is then 5.
